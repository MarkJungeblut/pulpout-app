A new Flutter fitness project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Rest API Model parsing:

See: https://github.com/google/json_serializable.dart/tree/master/example

Annotate your code with classes defined in package:json_annotation.

See lib/exercise.dart for an example of a file using these annotations.

See lib/exercise.g.dart for the generated file.

Run ```dart run build_runner build``` to generate files into your source directory.

## State management will be implemented with Riverpod
